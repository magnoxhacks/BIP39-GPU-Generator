WalletGen is a program for generating crypto wallets such as Bitcoin and EVM (ETH, BNB, MATIC, e.t.c), 
as well as searching for forgotten/lost wallets with an existing balance.

WalletGen is written in c++ and has an open source code for everyone. 
The speed of generating wallets exceeds the speed of programs written in python several times and 
depends more on your graphics card.

Features
1. Generate a single Bitcoin wallet.
2. Generate a single EVM wallet (ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.).
3. Search BTC wallets with balance (using the Internet - slower).
4. Search BTC wallets with balance (using the database - faster).
5. Search EVM wallets with balance (using the Internet - slower).
6. Search EVM wallets with balance (using the database - faster).


I would sincerely welcome your support. If you have found a forgotten or lost wallet using this program, 
I hope you will share a small part of your find.
